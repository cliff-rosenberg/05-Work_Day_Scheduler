## Usage

Opening 'index.html' in a web browser will bring up the main screen. Clicking on the 'Start Quiz' button starts the game. You will be asked questions and provide and answer by usinf the mouse to click on your choice. The timer starts running when the game starts and deincrements each second that passes. You receive a five second "penalty" time deduction each time you answer a question incorrectly. The game ends after all the questions are asked, or the timer reaches zero. After the game you are given a prompt to enter your name and that is stored along with your "score", which is the seconds left after the last question was answered.
